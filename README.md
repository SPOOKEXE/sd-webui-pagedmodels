# sd-webui-pagedmodels

Extension for Stable Diffusion Webui that pages models instead of loading them all into an infinite scrolling frame.
I made this extension because my webui freezes for a considerable time period when I open the Lora tab, having so many models.

## Installation

1. Go to "Extensions" tab
2. Switch to "Install from url"
3. Paste `https://github.com/SPOOKEXE/sd-webui-pagedmodels` to the "URL for extension's git repository" field and click "Install" button
4. After installation is complete, go to "Installed" tab and click "Apply and restart UI"

## Usage

This extension edits the "Checkpoints", "LORAs", "Hypernetworks" and "Textual Inversion" widgets on the stable diffusion webui.
This extension changes it by making clickable page numbers with a customizable amount of models per-page being displayed.
